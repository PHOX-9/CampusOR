## Purpose

This contribution defines the foundational visual identity for CampusOR by introducing a consistent color palette and a small set of reusable UI elements.

The goal is to improve:
- Clarity in queue states
- Visual consistency across campus services
- Accessibility and trust for users

---

## Color Palette

A restrained, accessible palette centered around Campus Blue and neutral slate tones.

- Primary color establishes brand identity
- Status colors communicate queue states instantly
- Neutral backgrounds reduce visual fatigue in kiosks and dashboards

(See `color-palette.md` for full details.)

## Core Visual Elements

### 1. Queue Status Badges
- Open / Paused / Full
- Designed for instant recognition
- Color + label for accessibility

### 2. Action Buttons
- Primary button for main actions (Join Queue)
- Secondary button for supporting actions
- Clear hierarchy and focus states

### 3. Queue Information Card
- Modular card used for queues or counters
- Emphasizes wait time and status
- Scales across mobile, desktop, and kiosk views

## Accessibility & Usability

- WCAG-compliant contrast ratios
- Status is never conveyed by color alone
- Large tap targets for touch devices
- Works in light mode and adaptable to dark mode

---

## Scope Compliance

✔ No full-page redesigns  
✔ No React or framework components  
✔ No external design systems  
✔ Limited, intentional color usage  

This contribution strictly focuses on visual foundations as required by Issue #72.
